# HeightModifier
Change the height of elements in a selection - now with multiplayer support! (requires the "Modify Tile" permission)

### Put the HeightModifier.js file in your plugins folder.

This plugin makes it easier to change the height of elements. Instead of using the tile inspector to individually change the height of an element per tile you can now select an area and change them all at once. You can also filter

## Filters
The filters will let you only affect specific types of elements so you don't have to do everything at once.
